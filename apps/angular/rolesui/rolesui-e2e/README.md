## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- Nx CLI (for running workspace commands)
- Cypress (included with the project)

### Development

Install dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running E2E Tests

To execute the end-to-end tests for RolesUI:

```bash
nx e2e rolesui-e2e
```

This command launches the Cypress test runner and runs the test suite against your RolesUI application.

---

## 📦 Deployment / CI

RolesUI E2E tests are typically executed as part of your CI/CD pipeline to automatically validate application
functionality before deployment. Ensure that the RolesUI application is available and accessible during the test
execution in your CI environment.

## 📌 Notes

- This project uses [Nx](https://nx.dev/) for workspace management.
- It leverages [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for writing and executing end-to-end tests.
- The folder structure is organized to clearly separate tests, fixtures, and support files, facilitating easy
  maintenance and scalability.
