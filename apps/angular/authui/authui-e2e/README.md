## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- Nx CLI (to run workspace commands)
- Cypress (included with the project)

### Development

Install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running E2E Tests

To execute the end-to-end tests for AuthUI:

```bash
nx e2e authui-e2e
```

This command will launch the Cypress test runner and run the test suite against your AuthUI application.

---

## 📦 Deployment / CI

AuthUI E2E tests are typically executed as part of your CI/CD pipeline to automatically validate application
functionality before deployment. Ensure that the target AuthUI application is available for testing when running these
tests in your CI environment.

## 📌 Notes

- This project uses [Nx](https://nx.dev/) for workspace management.
- It leverages [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for writing and executing end-to-end tests.
- The folder structure is organized to clearly separate test files, fixtures, and custom commands, making maintenance
  and scalability easier.
